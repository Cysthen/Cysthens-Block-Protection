type "/bp on" ingame to activate automatic debuffing for specifically Divine Protection
type "/bp off" ingame to disable.

This doesn't effect the higher level bubble and works off detecting the Divine Protection Icon. 

I have had problems with the addon when above a certain amount of buffs
(Like 30+ I think theres some kind of buff cap)
Aside from those handful of times it has always worked great.
